  This class provides a convenient interface for parsing URLs.

  Some fields in URLs are optionals. If the optional fields are absent, the
  object will return empty strings for these fields, but if you try to use this
  class to parse an invalid url, you will get empty strings to all fields.

  \note
  Currently URL usage become commonplace and it's easy to find abbreviated URLs
  such as "www.example.com". These abbreviated URLs aren't valid and Tufao::Url
  won't parse them, but this isn't really a problem if you are using Tufao::Url
  just to parse urls received from Tufao::HttpServerRequest, because user agents
  implementing the HTTP protocol always send valid URLs.
