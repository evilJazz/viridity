/*!
  This class provides a robust and high performance HTTP request router. It
  allows register AbstractHttpServerRequestHandler objects to handle requests
  that matches the mapping rules. The mapping rules are limited to use regular
  expressions to filter the url path component and, optionally, specify which
  method the object can handle.

  The type of mapping rules used in this class provides a predictable behaviour
  that is simple to understand and allow the use of caching algorithms to
  improve the performance.

  Did you note that HttpServerRequestRouter is a subclass of
  AbstractHttpServerRequestHandler? This design choice allows you to nest
  routes. But the nicest thing (for you) may not be the nested routing
  possibility, but the interface that this class is implementing. This design
  allows you to use the same request routing object to handle the requests
  coming from a HttpServer and a HttpsServer objects (or how many of them you
  need).

  When the router finds one matching request handler, it will call its
  handleRequest method passing the request and response objects and also the
  captured texts by the regular expression. If the found handler cannot handle
  the request (this is indicated by the return value), the router will continue
  its quest in the search of a worthy handler. If the router fails in its quest
  (when no handlers are found or when none of the found handlers are able to
  respond the request), the handleRequest method in the router returns false and
  the connection remains open. This mean that you should always create a handler
  that responds to any request with a <i>404 not found</i> as the last handler
  in the most top-level request router.
